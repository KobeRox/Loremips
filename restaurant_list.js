The whole menu looked good, but I played it safe and went with the 'pork' baos and the poutine. Oh wow! The buns were amazing, and the gravy on the poutine was out of this world. Not sure how they did it but I was very impressed! Considering how basic the dishes were the flavours were awesome. I'm going to go back again for sure, multiple times! Definitely go here!!

The food tastes fantastic, the portions are well sized and it normally doesn't take to long to come out of the kitchen. I 100% reccomend the mozerella sticks!

The staff seemed a bit over it, but I probably would be too!",

And then obviously just like everyone else on here we order the hot chocolate fudge cake + ice cream & the macaroon brownie.  Must say, the burgers aren't too bad but the dishes are a bit too pricey for the quantity served.  Never had any issues with being seated & staffing.  Plus it's opened 24 hours, so that's a bonus ✔️  If you're up for a decent meal after 2am when nothing else is opened, instead of going to a fast food drive through... This is the place to come to 😊.  Ambience : ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Staff : ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Food : ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Price : ⭐⭐⭐",

Seating looked good. 4 of us reached at this Bhavan at 8pm and had to wait for about 30 mins to get a table and then almost another 30 mins for someone to take our order. We were presented with a huge menu which got us excited. Quite a few items were missing from the menu so we had to try only what was available. Our order was – Bowls of Rasam, Mini idlis, Medu Vadais, Rava Dosai, Cheese Dosai and Ghee Roast Dosai, Faluda for deserts and Filter Coffee to finish.  If one has to wait 20-30 mins for mains to arrive after starters then it has to be worth the wait. Medu Vadas were good. Mini Idlis were not dipped in enough sambhar and No Ghee at all ‘totally disheartening’, Dosas were soggy when we got them. Faluda was just ok. And to end it Filter Coffee was too sweet for me but others found it good.  Washrooms were not clean and messy. If you can open such a huge restaurant then you can spend some money on hygiene too.  Overall it is just OK for me so wouldn’t sweat over it. Worth trying once but the hassle of parking, long wait for table deserves better quality and should well serve the expectation.",

Thanks.  Heres what went wrong:  Whole family had no plates,  1 fork and 1 spoon to finish 6 items. Asked the person waiting on us a few times. But nothing.   Even went up to the floor manager on how do youThen finally, more than half way through our meal, few spoons.   Starter arrived at the end of our meal. :|   The “paneer 65” came crashing in the middle with no plates. When the plates fjnally came, the noodles went cold. When we protested, nothing.   The person waiting on our table seemed to pass on the problems of the operation onto the customer - “not having enough clean cutlery is not customer’s problem.”   As a result of all of these things happening, we felt badly treated. It felt like “throw food at you” service.   I dont have a problem with self service. In fact, I was looking for such a sign. But to charge a premium & then this experience was just not right (granted it was a sunday afternoon; 28 July’19).  Food quality was good as we expect from a  saravanaa bhavan across the world. But because there was no coordination, the dosas came little cold not crispy.  It seemed quite clear to me that the kitchen operation was doing its own thing and the floor operation was completely chaotic. On the floor operation was nowhere in coordination with either customers or the kitchen.  Been to many Saravanaa Bhavans across the world and they are all popular (for good reason)and busy. Never like this.",

To begin with, the menu is huge but only when the waitress took our order did we find a large portion of the menu is not available in NZ. Basically all you can order is a curry or dosa. The menu needs to be adjusted to the NZ restaurant or we need to be told what's available when given the menu. This left us unsure what to order so we asked for the waitresses advice, she confidently suggested a paneer dish when we had already ordered chilli paneer. We went with her second option, a vegetable curry which was bland and unenjoyable. Hakka noodles were edible but again bland and non inspired. I will say the chilli paneer had good flavour and spice, which is why this gets an extra star, but it was dry and the paneer overcooked. Food crumbs all over the floor, which happens to be carpeted. More attentive customer service as well as a higher level of cleanliness is the least they could provide to make up for the food being so average.",

We had a group of 20 people and we were seated within 15 minutes. Everyone enjoyed their food. The buffalo wings, pork ribs, curly fries, and hot fudge cake were the most popular things ordered. For something different I ordered the spinach and mushroom Benny which I really liked. My Dad only got the sirloin steak and the meal was not enough for him. If you’re a big eater, it’s probably best to get an appetiser and a main course. The salad that comes with some meals can be better. They did forget some of our orders (probably because there were so many of us) but they were quick to fix it. So they were really on point last night.",

My small mocha came with a marshmallow and was a delicious blend of chocolate and coffee. The eggs benedict with bacon were tasty, but it did look quite small given the price tag. Favourite part was the hash brown base, and I also appreciate that the hollandaise sauce wasn’t too tart or too rich.   We also got the creamy mushrooms – which comes with salad, toast, and poached eggs. It’s a big portion for $19.50, so it would be great for anyone keen on a solid vegetarian meal. The mushrooms were very flavourful but the sauce becomes too rich after a while.   Overall, happy to recommend Sticky Fingers for those in the area. But would be great to see a more special range of dishes on their menu to keep up with local competitors.",

Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Value: 4/5 Recommend: 5/5 . . . This place is DEFINITELY WORTH ZOMATO GOLD 😍. The smashed avo dish is stacked on with literally a pile of avo and the vege hash is super crunchy too 🤤🥑. I feel like it's more of a pea and avo smash which I don't mind at all. The poached egg is cooked spot on as well with the runny egg yolk 👍. The chicken & haloumi salad was full of flavour and the portion size was pretty large which is 👌👌👌. The interior is pretty cute but the seatings are pretty limited so you gotta get there early. Definitely recommended!",

Disappointing as I came with a 6yo and 2yo and they were over waiting and I was over trying to keep them occupied. When the food finally arrived, the kids food was almost cold. I ordered a patty melt with curly fries and they brought out normal fries instead. The nachos we had ordered had stale chips. I went to the counter to ask for another batch of nachos with fresh chips and one of the workers cut me off and asked \"do you want a refund?\" I said \"no, I'm hungry, I want to eat this but it doesn't taste nice\" so she went to get another batch. The second batch of nachos we received tasted just like the previous batch so we requested the refund.  Many things that disappointed me here. The slow service (considering they were not too busy), the incorrect order, the cold food and the quality of the food.  What is a shame is that the worker that cut me off asking for a refund did so so suddenly as if it's a common thing to happen at their restaurant.  So sad to say, I'll never come back here again.",

The serving was quite good, particularly for the price (This set meal was the most expensive item at $20). It was nice to try a range of different curries, the cabbage and pea one was really nice. The dessert (think it was a lapsi) was really good. The set meal was a good way to get a taste of everything.",

Then I get asked, so how many is that, and I say, you tell me. What is a doz and she says 13???... So now my question is, if I order 3 doz I'm going to get 39 wings??.... HIghly unlikely.....That means they can't count?? I'm suprised anyone gets the correct change.....Their chinese food is RUBBISH !!... They should just sell burgers and chips, coz everything else is crap.  They need to go to Royal Cuisine in Royal Oak to understand what chinese food is. In fact, I recommend EVERYONE go to ROYAL CUISINE and order your chinese.... they have the BEST fried rice & sweet and sour... DIVINE!!  Don't waste your time at this place.  When you order, they don't even make suggestion to save you a bit... they are just ripping people off. I will need to get Consumers Institute to check them out when I get back.",

It was interesting seeing the food prep and the different ingredients in bins around the open kitchen space. I really enjoyed the look and feel.  Very simple, vegan menu. Although I myself am not vegan I didn't mind trying out the snickers toast (although there was no bread) and some guava juice. Juice was fine. The \"toast\" was interesting. It did get close to replicating aspects of snickers but not quite. I enjoyed the peanut butter and the different textures however it was all VERY rich and a bit dry so lot of water every bite.   Overall was a nice quick stop since I was in the area waiting for an appointment. Maybe better suited to someone wanting to have very organic and vegan based snack/small meal, but for me not intriguing or satisfying enough to go again.",

It’s such a peaceful kitchen offering nothing but the best vegetarian food, I initially came here in search of a book called The Secret Language of Birthdays - recommended to me by a friend. I ordered the Snickers Toast, took a seat & enquired about the book which the lovely waitress bought to my table. As I sat there, literally being blown away by this book - she comes & slides this plate of the most appetising piece of toast I’ll ever encounter. It was such a nice change from my usual hearty fry ups. Looking in from the outside, there’s nothing eye-catching about this place and there’s a good chance you’ve been past here a million times & just never noticed it...but that’s precisely what makes it special, it’s very much like a secret hideout. I think I’ve found my new favourite quiet place (:",

I recall visiting the same named place; then in  the Sandringham area, where among others, is another favourite of mine, named Paradise. We were warmly greeted & welcomed & were able to be seated quite comfortably. The owner came up & greeted us all,  making us feel comfortable & at home. The colorful  menu (photo) was easily read & we could not wait to try out the entrees as most of these are snack type Gujarati style food items. Their Sev Puri & Samosa Chaat & Khamman (2 varieties) Dahi Puri all went down so fast I honestly forgot to take a few photos. My apologies & compliments to their Chefs for preparation presentation & superfast delivery of each of the orders. We have heard commendably well about some of their dishes & were hoping to try a few more, we managed to get to a Puri Bhaji, Shrikhand Puri, Dabeli( vege burger like no other)  & enquired about their Gujarati Daal Rice combo, this was a real amazing surprise for us all, as all of us sampled it & were genuinely delighted at how superbly tasty it was. The rice was unbelievably fluffy & just outstanding & the Daal is most uniquely flavoured. I know, I am failing to describe it aptly. But believe it or not this is one special item which is a signature dish; among others. We also loved The freshly prepared sweet saffron Shrikhand with a Puri. The Shrikhand was freshly prepared & such a delight to relish, no Gujarati meal is complete without their famous Masala Tea/ Chai! We were absolutely delighted to have experienced such a simple vegetarian meal with such great satisfaction & happiness. The owner came over & shared a few humourous anecdotes in the vernacular & we had a most delightfully enjoyable evening.  The seating is simple so is the decor, & ambience is down to earth & not fancy at all. Its the culinary skills of this family team of amazing chefs whose brilliance outshines any shortcomings in decor or ambience. Once you sample their dishes, you are in your own world of culinary heaven. The one thing that truly stands out is their warmth & true hospitality this team deserves a full five rating based on just their culinary expertise & excellence. I realise that many flashier restaurants with way more flashier ambience & frills are not awarded a 5 rating easily by yours truly; so this is a genuine exception foodwise. I hope you too get a chance to get a taste of Gujarati food & I hope I shall drop a hint to name a special dish, which I hope you may get to experience someday; the name is Undhiyoo. Add one more, Kadi Khichdi. So do enquire if you can sample it sometime. The rest I shall let your tastebuds discover. Compliments to the entire team & owners of this splendid eatery for your kind hospitality & superb food. May you enjoy the patronage of many more food loving people who read this review.",
